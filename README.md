# ECE463_MicroArch
Microprocessor Architecture C++ Projects

## Project 1
Designed and implemented a flexible cache and memory hierarchy simulator and compared its performance and area of different memory hierarchy configurations using different benchmarks.

## Project 2
Constructed a global history with index sharing (gshare) branch predictor simulator and evaluated different configurations of branch predictors.

## Project 3
Constructed a simulator for an out-of-order superscalar processor that fetches and issues N instructions per cycle. Only the dynamic scheduling mechanism will be modeled in detail, i.e., perfect caches and perfect branch prediction are assumed.
